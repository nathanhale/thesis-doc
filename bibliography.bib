abstract = {We address the question of how participants in a small world experiment are able to find short paths in a social network using only local information about their immediate contacts. We simulate such experiments on a network of actual email contacts within an organization as well as on a student social networking website. On the email network we find that small world search strategies using a contact's position in physical space or in an organizational hierarchy relative to the target can effectively be used to locate most individuals. However, we find that in the online student network, where the data is incomplete and hierarchical structures are not well defined, local search strategies are less effective. We compare our findings to recent theoretical hypotheses about underlying social structure that would enable these simple search strategies to succeed and discuss the implications to social software design.},

In this paper, we describe several new strategies for ranking microblogs in a real-time search engine. Evaluating these ranking strategies is non-trivial due to the lack of a publicly available ground truth validation dataset. We have therefore developed a framework to obtain such validation data, as well as evaluation measures to assess the accuracy of the proposed ranking strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that it is beneficial for microblog search engines to take into account social network properties of the authors of microblogs in addition to properties of the microblog itself.},

We propose a method of ranking of tweets considering trustworthiness and content based popularity. The analysis of trustworthiness and popularity exploits the implicit relationships between the tweets. We model microblog ecosystem as a three-layer graph consisting of : (i) users (ii) tweets and (iii) web pages. We propose to derive trust and popularity scores of entities in these three layers, and propagate the scores to tweets considering the inter-layer relations. Our preliminary evaluations show improvement in precision and trustworthiness over the baseline methods and acceptable computation timings.},

include the named entity/trending keyword in the content. If I
understand correctly, they are loosely trying to find the subtopic
(content other than the named entity/trending keyword) similarity
(they call agreement) between the pairs of tweets.

        
As it is a workshop paper, it is short and presents a limited solution
for their main approach. I couldn't understand what they mean by
voting during the rank calculations. In the weighted agreement graph,
the edge weights correspond to agreement scores and they are adding up
the edge weights as the overall score and rank accordingly.

annote = {Uses mostly content features to do a good job of predicting the spread of hashtags. Essentially studies the spread of memes more than content recommendation, but it does talk a lot about content-based techniques (and completely ignores network topology).

        
Though it says that a lot of work has been done in topology-based approaches, this is true only of information spread, and not of content recommendation, at least in the sources cited.},
