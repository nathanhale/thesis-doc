abstract = {The increasing popularity of Twitter and other microblogs makes improved trustworthiness and relevance assessment of microblogs evermore important. We propose a method of ranking of tweets considering trustworthiness and content based popularity. The analysis of trustworthiness and popularity exploits the implicit relationships between the tweets. We model microblog ecosystem as a three-layer graph consisting of : (i) users (ii) tweets and (iii) web pages. We propose to derive trust and popularity scores of entities in these three layers, and propagate the scores to tweets considering the inter-layer relations. Our preliminary evaluations show improvement in precision and trustworthiness over the baseline methods and acceptable computation timings.},

But most users interaction with Twitter is still primarily focused on their social graphs, forcing the often inappropriate conflation of people I follow with stuff I want to read. We characterize some information needs that the current Twitter interface fails to support, and argue for better representations of content for solving these challenges. We present a scalable implementation of a partially supervised learning model (Labeled LDA) that maps the content of the Twitter feed into dimensions. These dimensions correspond roughly to substance, style, status, and social characteristics of posts. We characterize users and tweets using this model, and present results on two information consumption oriented tasks.},

In this paper, we describe several new strategies for ranking microblogs in a real-time search engine. Evaluating these ranking strategies is non-trivial due to the lack of a publicly available ground truth validation dataset. We have therefore developed a framework to obtain such validation data, as well as evaluation measures to assess the accuracy of the proposed ranking strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that it is beneficial for microblog search engines to take into account social network properties of the authors of microblogs in addition to properties of the microblog itself.},

We show how to solve this dilemma with Gibbs sampling, a simple Monte Carlo method used to perform approximate inference in factored probabilistic models. By using simulated annealing in place of Viterbi decoding in sequence models such as HMMs, CMMs, and CRFs, it is possible to incorporate non-local structure while preserving tractable inference. We use this technique to augment an existing CRF-based information extraction system with long-distance dependency models, enforcing label consistency and extraction template consistency constraints. This technique results in an error reduction of up to 9\% over state-of-the-art systems on two established information extraction tasks.},

Twitter presents tweets in chronological order. Recently, Twitter introduced a new ranking strategy that considers popularity of tweets in terms of number of retweets. This ranking method, however, has not taken into account content relevance or the twitter account. Therefore a large amount of pointless tweets inevitably flood the relevant tweets. This paper proposes a new ranking strategy which uses not only the content relevance of a tweet, but also the account authority and tweet-specific features such as whether a URL link is included in the tweet. We employ learning to rank algorithms to determine the best set of features with a series of experiments. It is demonstrated that whether a tweet contains URL or not, length of tweet and account authority are the best conjunction.},

@article{Backstrom2010,
abstract = {Predicting the occurrence of links is a fundamental problem in networks. In the link prediction problem we are given a snapshot of a network and would like to infer which interactions among existing members are likely to occur in the near future or which existing interactions are we missing. Although this problem has been extensively studied, the challenge of how to effectively combine the information from the network structure with rich node and edge attribute data remains largely open. We develop an algorithm based on Supervised Random Walks that naturally combines the information from the network structure with node and edge level attributes. We achieve this by using these attributes to guide a random walk on the graph. We formulate a supervised learning task where the goal is to learn a function that assigns strengths to edges in the network such that a random walker is more likely to visit the nodes to which new links will be created in the future. We develop an efficient training algorithm to directly learn the edge strength estimation function. Our experiments on the Facebook social graph and large collaboration networks show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches as well as approaches that are based on feature extraction.},

@article{Asur2010,
abstract = {In recent years, social media has become ubiquitous and important for social networking and content sharing. And yet, the content that is generated from these websites remains largely untapped. In this paper, we demonstrate how social media content can be used to predict real-world outcomes. In particular, we use the chatter from Twitter.com to forecast box-office revenues for movies. We show that a simple model built from the rate at which tweets are created about particular topics can outperform market-based predictors. We further demonstrate how sentiments extracted from Twitter can be further utilized to improve the forecasting power of social media.},

@article{Adamic2003,
abstract = {We address the question of how participants in a small world experiment are able to find short paths in a social network using only local information about their immediate contacts. We simulate such experiments on a network of actual email contacts within an organization as well as on a student social networking website. On the email network we find that small world search strategies using a contact's position in physical space or in an organizational hierarchy relative to the target can effectively be used to locate most individuals. However, we find that in the online student network, where the data is incomplete and hierarchical structures are not well defined, local search strategies are less effective. We compare our findings to recent theoretical hypotheses about underlying social structure that would enable these simple search strategies to succeed and discuss the implications to social software design.},
